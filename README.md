This project models a simple program based on AAC devices. It has only two levels of images.

This project is taken from the assignment: 
https://accessibilityeducation.github.io/assignments/AAC/AAC.html

For this project, we were given Catie Baker's starter code. My task was primarily to implement AACMappings and AACCategories. In this project I got to work with reading and understanding code written by someone that wasn't there to explain it, as well as the actual implementation of the project.
