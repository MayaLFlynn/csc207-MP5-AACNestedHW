This project models a simple program based on AAC devices. It has only two levels of images.

This project is taken from the assignment: 
https://accessibilityeducation.github.io/assignments/AAC/AAC.html


Professor Rebelsky gave an updated version of AAC.java.

Diogo and Simon helped very much help us figure out where the work was being done in the AACMappings. They told us that in order to swich categories, you have to check to see if you are in the 'home' category (or first page), then they said that if you are on the first page, then you should assume that you are creating a new category and do that work in add. Then you do the rest of the work in getText.
Alyssa and I asked each other a lot of questions. 
Candice gave me the idea for the associative array origionally for keeping the big list of categories.
